#Checklist:

1. Add motor id constants for the coral only wheel motor, the shared coral/algae wheel motor, and the algae only wheel motor
2. Add a wheel rotation speed constant
3. Add method to rotate coral wheels forward/backward using the above constant as the speed
4. Add constant that has coral switch id
5. Add method to read the coral switch state to see if we have a coral
6. [3], [4], and [5], but for algae. If [2] doesn't work for [3], then add a separate constant for algae wheel rotation speed.
